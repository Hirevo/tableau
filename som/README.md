About
-----

This is a library for building pretty tables in the terminal.

This is the SOM (Simple Object Machine) translation of the Rust code from the **`tableau`** library.

It supports all the same features as the Rust version, but with the following differences:

- No support for ANSI colors and attributes (yet)

Examples
--------

You can see examples of how to use this library by looking at [**the different examples available**](https://github.com/Hirevo/tableau/tree/main/som/examples).
